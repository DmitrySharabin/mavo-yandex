# Yandex Disk Backend

**Warning:** The plugin is currently in alpha and still is a work in progress. It may have (even for sure does üòù) bugs. Play around with it, and let us know if you encounter any bugs!

## Getting started

- Open the folder with the file you'd like to store your data in on your Yandex Disk
- Copy the URL from the address bar and append the file name to the URL (separated by a slash)
- Use the result URL as the `mv-source`/`mv-storage`/`mv-init` value.

**OR**

- Make the file public (by sharing it) and use the provided URL as the `mv-source`/`mv-storage`/`mv-init` value.

Done!
